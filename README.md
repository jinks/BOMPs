Bolt-On Mission Probes
===================
Bolt-On Mission Probes were unmanned pods for KSP before such a thing existed in the stock game.

Although vanilla probe cores are now readily available, BOMPs hold a special place in the hearts of many veteran KSP players.  
They are also darn pretty ;)

This project aims to bring BOMPs into the shiny new world of the newer KSP versions.
